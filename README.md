## Overview

I decided to use some designs from the Youtube series Refactoring UI as practice for building web pages from static sketch files. This page is from the Youtube video "Bad About".

The page features several panels and an in-page navigation. My focus for this project has been was organization, both in creating composable react components but also in CSS through using a naming convention called Block Element Modifier (BEM).

Install the files to see how it turned out!

Note: since there is no mobile design I haven't made an attempt at making it responsive. However, it's built using css grid and flex-boxes so it's in a good position to make it mobile-friendly.
