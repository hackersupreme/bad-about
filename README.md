## Overview

I decided to use some designs from the Youtube series Refactoring UI as practice for building web pages from static sketch files. This page is from the Youtube video *Refactoring UI: Bad About*.

The page features several panels and an in-page navigation. My focus for this project was organization, both in creating composable react components but also in CSS through using a naming convention called Block Element Modifier (BEM).

Install the files to see how it turned out!

Note: since there is no mobile design I haven't made an attempt at making it responsive. However, it's built using css grid and flex-boxes so it's in a good position to make it mobile-friendly.

Get both here: https://nodejs.org/

###### Instructions

1. Create file directory on your local device
2. Download files to that directory

_note: PNG images are for this document, not needed for the project_

3. Using a command line software, enter the directory
```
cd directory-name
```
4. Use npm install to get the node modules
```
npm install
```
5. Use npm start to start the server
```

#### App

The top level component for this page is `App` and it's found in the file `App.js`. It contains three child components that it wraps in a `div`: `Nav`, `Header`, and `Main`. 

The `Nav` component contains the top bar navigation while the `Header` component contains the header of the page located right below the nav. The `Main` component contains the in-page navigation sidebar and the panels for comments on the product grouped by category.

All of the information the page needs is organized in a file called `data.js`. I separated out the data from the components to ensure they are composable. This is what the data looks like:

```
export default {
  ProductName: 'Apple iPhone X',
	Facts: [
		{
			content: "Apple are charging higher than normal rates for repairing the screen ($279)",
			author: "Charlotte J",

		},
		{

	],

		}
	]
}
```

#### Main

The `Main` component recieves the facts, opinions, and experiences of the product as arrays. It has an `aside` element for the in-page navigation on the left and a `main` element for the three panels on the right.

The `main` element contains three `Panel` components for the three data types. Each panel recieves its respective array of data that it turns into a list of `Article` or `ExperienceActicle` components. 

The `Main` component keeps track of which `Panel` component is the active component in the page and updates it as the user scrolls. Each `Panel` component's position relative to the viewport as well as the offset from the top of the page is tracked. A ref is passed onto each `Panel` component which is used to update the element's top and bottom page offsets whenever the page scrolls.

I configured the `aside` navigation to assign an "active" class to whichever `Panel` is in the viewport.
